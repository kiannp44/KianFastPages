    "# Questions and Answers\n",
    "1. Do you have any experience with Agile methodology? A: Difference companies have different versions of Agile and they use it depending on how they need. For Qualcomm they planned everything quarter based and had a road map for everything they were going to do. It is very important and they work on sprints, 1 month increments, 2 month increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Twitter Layoff? A: Most of his team was layed off and he was working remotely but he was forced to move to San Francisco however he didn't so he got layed off. He started looking for a job ASAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What did you do at Qualcomm? A: They hosted a git lab of twitter and add 100,000 repositories before they left and they were concerned with who was downloading what. Built an analytics infrastructure in order to predict when to archive and delete the repository. If no one is downloading it, we delete it through code. Data Scientists predict where the customer demand and the sales are. \n"
